# Personal Lean Theorem Prover Code

- This repo will consist of exercises and most of the code written in my Fall 2023 Directed Study on topics of formal theorem proving in the Lean programming language.
- Note that reading tactic proofs in lean is made easier when stepping through line by line having access to tactic state.
- Lean 4 has an [interactive online editor](https://lean.math.hhu.de/) and so does Lean 3 [here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-web-editor/)
