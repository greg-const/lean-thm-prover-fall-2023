# Personal Lean Theorem Prover Code

- This repo contains examples of code written during my Fall 2023 Directed Study on topics of formal theorem proving in the Lean programming language.
- Contained are exercises from *Theorem Proving in Lean 3*, *Theorem Proving in Lean 4*, and *Functional Programming in Lean 4*.
- gcd_final.lean contains many auxiliary lemmas about GCD and its properties, as well as a formal verification of Euclid's GCD algorithm.
- Note that reading tactic proofs in lean is made easier when stepping through line by line having access to tactic state.
- Lean 4 has an [interactive online editor](https://lean.math.hhu.de/) and so does Lean 3 [here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-web-editor/).
